To use the weather app, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. You will need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to access weather data. Once you have obtained your API key, replace your_api_key_here in the script.js file with your actual API key.

To search for weather conditions, enter a city name in the search bar and click the "Search" button. The weather information for the entered city should be displayed.
